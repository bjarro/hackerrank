Current approach:
repeated search and evaluate - max of m tries?

---------------
Possibly better approach: 

-------
cumulative ratio approach
 - represent next machines as a cumsum output of the previous machines + 1 
   - Use ratio to compute

----
 - get initial days using coeff and goal
 - increase day by walking through each machines, multiplying
