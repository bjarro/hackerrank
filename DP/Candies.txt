1. Count dups present
2. Compute initial offset
3. if last < 1: # we need to add offset to whole range
                      # (dups can reduce offset depending on position)
3.1. Left to right: offset - (dups present - dups encountered)

4. if Last >=1: we need to add offset to whole range (negative offset)
   	# (dups can reduce offset depending on position)
4.1 Same as 3.1


3 and 4 is equivalent except for first acc?


How to store dups encountered?
a. List of total encountered (N)
 - Search one to one

b. List of indices (M) M = number of dups
 - Keep track of current total
 - Search by comparing indices
